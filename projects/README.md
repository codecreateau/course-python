# Projects

Projects are larger exercises that can span multiple weeks and multiple topics.
These are suitable for coding camps or as capstone projects for a term. They can
often be used for advanced students who might already have some experience in
the course, and is looking for something new to try whilst the beginner students
are working on fundamental exercises.

All projects should aim to have large amounts of area for creativity, but also
provide a framework for students to build their ideas on, preventing them from
having wild ideas that they won't be able to build within the course time.
