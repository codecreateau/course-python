# Wiki

Build a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) for something the student is
passionate about. For example, it could be about all the planet in the Star
Wars universe or a student directory for their year group. It should have
information on the internet that can easily be copied into text files to act
as initial data.

- Star Wars
- Marvel
- Disney
- Shrek
- Harry Potter
- The Last of Us (Game)
- Student Directory
- School Directory
- NBA
